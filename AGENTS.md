# Guidelines for Codex agents

- Always run `make fmt` and `make test` before committing.
- Use Tailwind CSS utilities when updating templates, but keep Bootstrap components unless instructed otherwise.
- Do not modify models or database migrations unless explicitly requested.
- The notes blueprint exposes both `notes.detail` and `notes.view_note` for `/notes/<id>`.
- Merge duplicated `DOMContentLoaded` listeners into a single entry point in `main.js`.
- All `<form method="post">` must import `components/csrf.html` and call
  `csrf_field()` immediately after the `<form>` tag.
